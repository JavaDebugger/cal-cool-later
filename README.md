# Hello World Project

This is a basic Hello World project. You can start customizing it as needed.

## How to Run

- If you add a Python file (e.g., `main.py`), run it with:
  ```sh
  python3 main.py
  ```
- If you add a JavaScript file (e.g., `index.js`), run it with:
  ```sh
  node index.js
  ```
- If you add a TypeScript file (e.g., `index.ts`), compile and run it with:
  ```sh
  npx tsc index.ts && node index.js
  ```

Feel free to add your code and update this README as your project grows.
